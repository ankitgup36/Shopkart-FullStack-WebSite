Description

I'm working on developing a website to enhance my front-end skills and gain valuable experience. My goal is to create a website that loads quickly and looks great on mobile devices. I want to optimize it for both speed and search engine optimization (SEO) to ensure it performs well in search results.

Within the next month, I plan to complete the website development, optimize the code, and fix any issues using linters, which are tools that help identify and fix coding errors.

To achieve a fast loading time, I have set a target of 0.4 seconds for fetching and rendering the website. I will employ several techniques to achieve this, such as optimizing images to reduce their file size, minifying CSS and JavaScript files, and utilizing browser caching.

Initially, I'll focus on the front-end development, making sure the website design is responsive and provides a smooth user experience across different devices.

Throughout the project, I'll pay close attention to debugging and code quality. I'll use linters to identify and rectify any coding errors, ensuring that the code is clean and maintainable.

By focusing on website optimization, I'm confident that I can achieve the desired loading time and create a proficient front-end design. Along the way, I'm excited to learn and grow from this experience.



Workflow tracking
To professionally manage and track my project progress, I've developed an Excel sheet. Allotting one hour daily ensures timely completion and allows me to monitor tasks effectively.
